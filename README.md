I created this repository so that I could use a data set, "Vegetarian and Vegan restaurants" downloaded from the website data.world.


A list of over 18,000 restaurants that serve vegetarian or vegan food in the US.

About This Data

This is a list of over 18,000 restaurants in the US that serve vegetarian or vegan food. The data is provided by Datafiniti's Business Database.

Data includes address, city, state, business name, business categories, menu data, phone numbers, and more.

The data in this data set was used to determine the most vegetarian and vegan-friendly cities in the US.

The URL for this data set can be found at: https://data.world/datafiniti/vegetarian-vegan-restaurants. 
(The file could not be assessed through either R script using downloader::download or RCurl::getURL)

Reason for choosing this:

Personally, I have really struggled to find good Vegetarian Restaurants in Chicago so this data interested me!
